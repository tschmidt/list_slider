= list_slider

+list_slider+ is a jQuery plugin that takes a list element, finds the additional
information for each item in the list and hides it. It will then add a link so
that the user may toggle the visibility of this information.

The plugin is very specific at this point (as far as the expected markup) but
will be updated in the future.
